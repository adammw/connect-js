Facebook JavaScript SDK
===============================

This repository contains a custom, unsupported fork of the open source JavaScript 
SDK that allows you to utilize Facebook on your website. Except as otherwise 
noted, the Facebook Connect JavaScript SDK is licensed under the Apache Licence, 
Version 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

Status
------

This is an *unsupported* release. In order to guide the development of the library
and allow you to freely inspect and use the source, we have open sourced the
client JavaScript SDK.

Documentation
-------------

We have made API documentation available for the public APIs [here][docs]. In
addition, the code itself contains full documentation for the private APIs if
you want to study the internals.

We are maintaining a [changelog][changelog] as we update the SDK. Since this is
an Beta SDK, we might need to break compatibility between releases if the need
arises.

The repository also contains simple [examples][examples] showing the use of the
SDK with popular JavaScript libraries such as [Dojo][Dojo], [jQuery][jQuery],
[MooTools][MooTools], [Prototype][Prototype] and [YUI][YUI].
